/**
 *  `PROPLocationManager` is a wrapper for a CLLocationManager. Its purpose is to begin monitoring for significant location updates and when those updates arrive, cache the last known location on the device. It will provide the last known location (or nil) upon request. If the user does not allow significant location updates or if significant location updates are turned off, requesting the last known location will return nil. If you want the application to be notified of significant location updates while in the background, you need to enable the location updates background mode in the Capabilities tab of the Xcode project.
